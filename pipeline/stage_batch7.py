"""Stage batch 7 (TARGETED tobacco, target_pool.py draw tobacco chlorine, 2026-09-24). Copy of the fixed template.
(/tmp/batch.json was a stale unwritable file from the last chat; this batch lives at /tmp/b7/batch.json.)

Pattern established over batches 1-4 (2026-09-23). Copy this file, fill in D,
run it, then `python3 pipeline/propose.py apply`.

  D[i] = (decision, [molecule spans], "why")
     decision is 'A' approve / 'R' reject / 'S' split
     i is the 1-based position in the batch JSON, NOT a review.jsonl row index
     molecule spans are hand-specified and MUST be verbatim substrings
     descriptors are AUTO-EXTRACTED from the ontology, so verbatim by construction

  EXCL[i] = {"term", ...} drops ontology terms that appear only in a COMPARISON
     clause ("reminiscent of cedar") or belong to a flavour rather than an odour.

THE GUARANTEE: every span is substring-checked against its own sentence and the
script REFUSES TO WRITE if any check fails. It has never had to. Do not weaken it.

ROW MATCHING is on (source_id, FULL whitespace-normalised sentence), NOT on row
index — propose.py keys on index and a split shifts every index behind it.
Bug 4 (fixed 2026-09-24): this used to key on the first 110 chars, which collides
(68 keys / 151 rows); it put a batch-5 proposal on the wrong row and skipped two
batch-6 rows. The full sentence still repeats across split copies (34 keys, all
parent/split_of pairs), so a key maps to a LIST: the match is the one undecided
row; none undecided = skipped and reported; more than one = REFUSE.
Already-decided rows are never overwritten.
